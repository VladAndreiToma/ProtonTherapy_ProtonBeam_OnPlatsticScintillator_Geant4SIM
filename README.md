GEANT4 Simulation of a Proton Beam for Proton Therapy Research
I’m pleased to announce the completion of a GEANT4 simulation focused on proton beam interactions with a plastic scintillator. In this simulation, I modeled a proton beam with energies ranging up to 200 MeV, aiming to calculate the deposited dose—a critical factor in optimizing proton therapy for cancer treatment.
Leveraging the modular object-oriented programming (OOP) approach in C++, I designed a highly adaptable simulation. This OOP structure allows for seamless scalability of the beam’s energy range from 60 to 250 MeV, replicating the exact conditions needed to target tumors at varying depths within the body. The flexibility of C++ modularity played a key role in efficiently adjusting parameters and enhancing the accuracy of the dose deposition analysis.
Key Features of the Simulation:
Beam Energy: Scalable from 60 to 250 MeV, with focus on 200 MeV for deep tissue targeting
Material: Plastic scintillator to simulate tissue-like properties
Objective: Precise calculation of deposited dose
Purpose: Contributing to improved accuracy and safety in proton therapy treatments
This modular C++ approach makes the simulation adaptable for future studies and further refinements, enhancing the precision of proton therapy and supporting its evolution as a leading treatment for cancer.
